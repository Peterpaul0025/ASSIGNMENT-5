Creates a dictionary of student names → marks, prompts the user for a name, and looks up the marks. It does a case-insensitive search (tries exact then lowercased) and prints either Name's marks: X or Student not found.

List slicing & reversing program —:
Builds a list of numbers 1–10, extracts the first five items with numbers[:5], then reverses that slice with [::-1]. Prints the original list, the extracted list, and the reversed extracted list.
